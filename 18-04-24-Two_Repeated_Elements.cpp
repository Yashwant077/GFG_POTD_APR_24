Problem Description: Two Repeated Elements

You are given an integer n and an integer array arr of size n+2. All elements of the array are in the range from 1 to n. Also, all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.
Note: Return the numbers in their order of appearing twice. So, if X and Y are the repeating numbers, and X's second appearance comes before second appearance of Y, then the order should be (X, Y).

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1,2,1,3,4,3}
Output: 
1 3
Explanation: 
In the given array, 1 and 3 are repeated two times and as 1's second appearance occurs before 2's second appearance, so the output should be 1 3.


Example 2:

Input:
n = 2
arr[] = {1,2,2,1}
Output: 
2 1
Explanation: 
In the given array, 1 and 2 are repeated two times and second occurence of 2 comes before 1. So the output is 2 1.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function repeatedElements() which takes an integer array arr[] and an integer n as inputs (the size of the array is n + 2 and elements are in the range [1, n]) and finds the two repeated elements in the array and return them in an array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1). 

Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
